# sonarcloud-test
This project is intended to teach beginners working with sonarQube and sonarCloud.
This is based on public repo maegges65/junit-tests (commit 8b662e3).

## Project Structure
Example Code is found in `src/main/java`, the associated tests can be found in `src/test/java`, dependencies are declared in `build.gradle`.
If you use IntelliJ&rt;, a simple import from gradle should suffice, for eclipse a

	./gradlew eclipse

is suggested.

## Free Use
This repository may be used freely, providing that changes are not comitted on the master branch.
To clone it from the command line, use:

    git clone https://github.com/brechtgermis/sonarcloud-test

## Description

For each example, there is a separate package in both the `main` and the `test` folder.

### demo

This has a simple class with a method whose logic depends solely on the method's parameters. The test class demonstrates how to cover the complete code.

### demo2

A hypothetical example of a servo system with actors and sensors, where the latter are described as interfaces.

The test class demonstrates the use of mocks and verification of method calls.

### demo3

Similar to demo2, but now actor and sensor are (stupid) concrete classes.

The test class demonstrates the use of spies.

### demo4

Based on demo3, but this time a factory is used to create actor and sensor.

The test class demonstrates the use of the factory to avoid spies.

### demo5

Based on demo4, but this time with a `try {...} finally {...}` block.

The test class demonstrate how to test behaviour for exceptions.

### demo6

Based on demo3, but uses `Mockito.mockConstruction()` to mock constructors and verify method calls.

### demo7

A simple example to demonstrate the the use of inorder verification.

### robot

A simple example of a hyptothetical robot that moves along a rectangular spiral outwards.
Look at the branch `refactoring` to see how this setup can be used for reactoring.
